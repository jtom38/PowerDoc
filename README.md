# PowerDoc

PowerShell Module to build function and class documentation.

## About

This project was made to make it easier for PowerShell Developers to be able to build class and function documentation easier.  My goald was to add PowerDoc to the build process to document the code for public use.

## Install

TBD

## How to use

1. Import-Module PowerDoc
2. Start-PowerDoc
3. Enjoy

## Documentation Result

PowerDoc is an example of what type of files you would be able to request.  Currently .md and .html files are generated.  This only documents the classes and functions though, if you have more you want to add you will need to adjust your files.
